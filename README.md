# Taxi Cab Investment Case Study

This project is a Data Science case study where I analyze two taxi companies using real taxi cab data to determine the better investment option for an investing firm.  

## Project Overview
Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Hypothesis Testing, I compare key performance metrics such as:  
- Trip volume and demand trends  
- Revenue and fare distribution  
- Driver efficiency and ride durations  
- Customer satisfaction metrics (if applicable)  

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Visualizations for insights  
- Statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA)  
- Business recommendations based on findings  

## Stakeholder Summary
To present my findings clearly to stakeholders, I created a slideshow summarizing key insights and inferences. This provides a high-level overview of the analysis and final recommendation in an accessible format.  

## Key Findings and Recommendation
After thorough analysis, I present a data-driven recommendation on which taxi company offers a better investment opportunity.
