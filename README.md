# Taxi Cab Investment Case Study

This project is a Data Science case study where I analyze two hypothetical taxi companies to determine the better investment option for an investing firm.

## Project Overview
Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Hypothesis Testing, I compare key performance metrics such as:
- Trip Volume and Demand Trends
- Revenue and Fare Distribution
- Driver Efficiency and Ride Durations
- Customer Satisfaction Metrics (if applicable)

## Methodology
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Visualizations for Insights
- Statistical Hypothesis Testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA)
- Business Recommendations Based on Findings

## Key Findings and Recommendation
After thorough analysis, I present a data-driven recommendation on which taxi company offers a better investment opportunity.
